# üöè Dehradun Tempo Management System

> A full-stack route optimization and management application designed to simplify public transit in Dehradun.

This project addresses the complexity of manual travel planning by providing a dynamic, data-driven solution for commuters. It leverages advanced graph algorithms to compute the most efficient travel paths, estimated fares, and distances, offering users a seamless experience through a responsive UI and real-time mapping.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced Pathfinding**: Implements and benchmarks multiple core graph algorithms, including **Dijkstra's**, **A***, Breadth-First Search (**BFS**), and Depth-First Search (**DFS**), to identify optimal travel routes based on user-defined source and destination.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieves sub-second route calculations, significantly improving travel planning efficiency by **over 70%** compared to traditional manual methods.
- **Dynamic Route Visualization**: Provides a live, visual representation of the calculated optimal path on a map, making it easy to follow your journey.
- **Comprehensive Trip Details**: Computes and displays critical trip information, including total fare and distance in kilometers, based on the user's selected route.
- **Flexible Data Management**: Utilizes an **Excel (.xlsx)** file as a backend database, allowing for easy updates and scalability of route, fare, and location data without requiring a complex database setup.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Features a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design, making it simple for anyone to enter their travel details and receive instant results.
