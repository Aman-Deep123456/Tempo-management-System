🛣️ Dehradun Tempo Management System
!

📌 Project Overview
The Dehradun Tempo Management System is a full-stack route optimization and management application designed to simplify public transit in Dehradun. The project addresses the complexity of manual travel planning by providing a dynamic, data-driven solution for commuters.

This system leverages advanced graph algorithms to compute the most efficient travel paths, estimated fares, and distances. It provides users with a seamless experience through a responsive user interface and real-time mapping technology.

✨ Key Features
Advanced Pathfinding: Implements and benchmarks multiple core graph algorithms—including Dijkstra's, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS)—to identify optimal travel routes based on user-defined source and destination.

Performance Optimization: Achieves sub-second route calculations, significantly improving travel planning efficiency by over 70% compared to traditional manual methods.

Dynamic Route Visualization: Provides a live, visual representation of the calculated optimal path on a map.

Comprehensive Trip Details: Computes and displays critical trip information, including total fare and distance in kilometers, based on the user's selected route.

Flexible Data Management: Utilizes an Excel (.xlsx) file as a backend database, allowing for easy updates and scalability of route, fare, and location data without requiring a complex database setup.

Intuitive User Interface: Features a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design, making it simple for anyone to enter their travel details and receive instant results.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheet

Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, BFS, DFS
